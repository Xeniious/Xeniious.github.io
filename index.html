                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <mydescription>
                        I am a recent college graduate with a passion for machine learning and data analytics. My degree 
                        in Computer Science has given me hands-on experience with various machine learning
                        algorithms and data analysis techniques as well as the knowledge to be able to learn and adapt to new situations. 
                        I am skilled in programming languages such as C++, C#, Python, and SQL, and I am always eager to learn and apply 
                        new technologies to solve complexproblems. I am dedicated, detail-oriented, and committed to delivering 
                        high-quality results in my projects.

                        A Galaga inspired game in which you fight ships that slowly come down towards you.
                        As you progress through levels, you will meet different enemies with unique weapons and
                        eventually bosses providing a fun but challenging new experience to the 2D shooter. 
                        Powerups are provided to the player so that they may get an edge as well!

                        In a black and white world where color has never been known, a girl adventuring through her hometowns forest
                        finds a magical paint gun. This gun has the power to bring colors never before seen by anyone, and with these colors
                        comes wacky side effects! In this 2D platformer, you apply paints to the world to bring life and color to it
                        while solving puzzles so you can move forward. Progress through to discover new paints such as the speed boosting paint, 
                        floaty paint, and much more!
